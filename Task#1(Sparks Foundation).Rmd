## Linear Regression By using R
In this section we will see how the R language can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

## Simple Linear Regression
In this linear regression task, we are able to expect the proportion of marks that a student is anticipated to score based upon the variety of hours they studied. That is an easy linear regression venture as it involves simply variables.

#### Set Directory for reading the Data sets

To get the current the directory: 
```{r echo=TRUE}
getwd()
```


To set the directory where I save the data sets:
```{r echo=TRUE}
setwd("C:/Users/Ali Raza/Desktop/Sparks Foundation/Task#1")
```

## Data Sets
Read the data sets that given for solving the Problem:
The given data sets is based on student scores.

```{r echo=TRUE}
s_scores <- read.csv("student_scores - student_scores.csv")
```

#### To Inspect the Data Sets
To View the Upper Row of Given Data Sets
```{r echo=TRUE}
head(s_scores)
```

To check the detail of Data Sets

```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(s_scores)
```

## Loading required R packages For solving the Problem

* Load required packages:
    + ggplot2: for create plot
    + tidyverse for data manipulation and visualization
    + ggpubr: creates easily a publication ready-plot
        - Installed ggrepel for used ggpubr
```{r eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
```

        
## Visualization

The column names that I used for plotting or visualizing is 
`r colnames(s_scores)`

### Scatter plot

Create Scatter plot for the Hours and Scores

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
ggplot(s_scores, aes(x = Hours, y = Scores)) +
    geom_point() +
    ggtitle("Hours VS Scores") +
    theme_pubr() +
    theme(legend.title = element_text(size = 9, face = "bold")
        )
```

### Scatter Plot with Regression Line

Create Scatter Plot with Regression Line for the Hours and Scores

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
ggplot(s_scores, aes(x = Hours, y = Scores))+
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Hours Vs Scores") +
  stat_smooth() +
  theme_pubr() +
  theme(legend.title = element_text(size = 9, face = "bold")
        )
```

The graph above shows a linearly growing relationship among the Hours and the scores variables. This is a superb factor, because one important assumption of linear regression is that the relationship between the final results and predictor variables is linear and additive.

**So the Graph shows the positive relation.**

### Coorelation

The Correlation coefficient between Hours and Scores of Students.
```{r echo=TRUE}
cor(s_scores$Scores, s_scores$Hours)
```

The correlation coefficient measures the level of the association between two variables x and y.

Its value ranges between -1 (perfect negative correlation: when x increases, y decreases) and +1 (perfect positive correlation: when x increases, y increases).

A value closer to 0 suggests a weak relationship between the variables. A low correlation (-0.2 < x < 0.2) probably suggests that much of variation of the outcome variable (y) is not explained by the predictor (x). In such case, we should probably look for better predictor variables.

**In our Task, the correlation coefficient is large enough, so we can continue by building a linear model of y as a function of x.**

## Linear Regression Model
The simple linear regression tries to find the best line to predict Scores on the basis of Hours.

The linear model equation can be written as follow: **Scores = b0 + b1 x Hours**

The R function **lm()** can be used to determine the beta coefficients of the linear model:

```{r echo=TRUE}
linear_model <- lm(Scores~Hours, data = s_scores)
linear_model
```

The Result tell us about the **intercept** and **beta coefficient** of the **Hours**.

### Plotting
Display the Scatter Plot with Simple Linear Regression Line.
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
ggplot(s_scores, aes(x = Hours, y = Scores))+
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Hours Vs Scores") +
  stat_smooth(method = lm) +
  theme_pubr() +
  theme(legend.title = element_text(size = 9, face = "bold"))
```

### Summary of Model
I displaying the statistical summary of the model.

```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(linear_model)
```

The summary outputs shows 6 components, including:
* **Call**. Shows the function call used to compute the regression model.
* **Residuals**. Provide a quick view of the distribution of the residuals, which by definition have a mean zero. Therefore, the median should not be far from zero, and the minimum and maximum should be roughly equal in absolute value
* **Coefficients**. Shows the regression beta coefficients and their statistical significance. Predictor variables, that are significantly associated to the outcome variable, are marked by stars.
* **Residual standard error (RSE)**, **R-squared (R2)** and the **F-statistic** are metrics that are used to check how well the model fits to our data.

### Coefficients significance
```{r echo=TRUE}
confint(linear_model)
```

### Check the Model
For check the model accuracy, I measure the percentage in predicting.
```{r echo=TRUE}
sigma(linear_model)*100/mean(s_scores$Scores)
```
**So the error percentage is `r sigma(linear_model)*100/mean(s_scores$Scores)`**

## Make Prediction
Predict the score on 9.25 hours, according to given problems or task.

```{r echo=TRUE}
predict(linear_model, data.frame(Hours = 9.25))
```
